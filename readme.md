# Why Other Users Can Be Hacked

## Your page looks like Facebook
The HTML you provided imitates Facebook perfectly.
Users who see it may think it is the real Facebook login page.
If they enter their email and password, they are not logging into Facebook — they are sending their credentials to your server.
This is called a #“phishing attack”.
